                                    Through the Platform, we (Iterwesttravels.com, UAE, and its affiliate distribution
                                    partners) offer an online platform enabling Trip Providers to advertise, market,
                                    sell, promote, and/or offer their products and services for order, purchase,
                                    reservation, rental, or hire. Visitors to the Platform can discover, search,
                                    compare, and make orders, reservations, purchases, or payments (referred to as the
                                    "Trip Service"). By utilizing the Trip Service (e.g., making a Trip Reservation),
                                    you enter into a direct contractual relationship with the Trip Provider for the
                                    reservation or purchase of a product or service. Once you make your Trip
                                    Reservation, we act solely as an intermediary between you and the Trip Provider,
                                    transmitting relevant details of your reservation to the Trip Provider(s) and
                                    sending you a confirmation email on behalf of the Trip Provider.

                                    The prices offered by Trip Providers on our Platform are notably competitive within
                                    the industry. All Trip prices displayed include VAT/sales tax and other applicable
                                    taxes and fees (subject to potential tax changes), unless otherwise specified on our
                                    Platform or in the confirmation email/ticket. Ticket prices are per person or group
                                    and are subject to validity or expiration as indicated on the ticket, if applicable.
                                    Additional fees and taxes (such as tourist/city tax) may be imposed by the Trip
                                    Provider in case of a no-show or cancellation.

                                    Occasionally, our Platform may feature cheaper rates for specific stays, products,
                                    or services provided by Trip Providers. However, these discounted rates may come
                                    with special restrictions and conditions, such as being non-cancelable and
                                    non-refundable. Before making a reservation, carefully review the relevant product,
                                    service, and reservation conditions and details for any such conditions.

                                    We strive for you to secure the lowest available price for your desired product or
                                    service. If you discover your chosen property booked through our Platform at a lower

                                    Unless specified otherwise, our service is provided at no cost to consumers. Unlike
                                    many other platforms, we do not impose charges for our Trip Service or tack on any
                                    additional reservation fees. You will directly remit the relevant amount to the Trip
                                    Provider as indicated in your Trip Reservation, along with any applicable taxes,
                                    levies, and fees, if applicable.

                                    Trip Providers compensate Iterwesttravels.com with a commission, which constitutes a
                                    small percentage of the product price (e.g., room rate), after the end user has
                                    completed the purchase or utilization of the Trip Provider's service or product
                                    (e.g., after the guest has stayed at the accommodations and settled the payment).
                                    Trip Providers have the option to enhance their ranking by augmenting their
                                    commission. This increase in commission, at the Trip Provider's discretion, may vary
                                    from one product to another and is factored into the ranking algorithm to determine
                                    the Default Ranking. Preferred partners, in exchange for a superior position in the
                                    ranking, remunerate a higher commission.

                                    Only Trip Providers with a commercial agreement with Iterwesttravels.com are

                                    open platforms such as Amazon or eBay, Iterwesttravels.com does not function as a

                                    If available, certain Trip Providers offer the option for Trip Reservations to be
                                    paid to the Trip Provider during the reservation process, either in full or
                                    partially, according to the Trip Provider's payment policy. This payment can be made
                                    securely online, to the extent supported by your bank. For specific products and
                                    services, Iterwesttravels.com facilitates the payment of the relevant product or

                                    (referred to as the payment facilitation service) through third-party payment
                                    processors, acting on behalf of the Trip Provider (Iterwesttravels.com does not

                                    as the merchant of record). Payments are securely processed from your credit/debit
                                    card or bank account to the bank account of the accommodation provider through a
                                    third-party payment processor. Any payment facilitated by us and transferred to the
                                    Trip Provider constitutes final settlement of the relevant product or service's
                                    booking price, and you cannot reclaim such paid funds.

                                    For certain (non-refundable) rates or special offers, Trip Providers may require
                                    upfront payment via wire transfer (if available) or credit card. Consequently, your
                                    credit card may be pre-authorized or charged upon making the Trip Reservation,
                                    sometimes without an option for refund. Before making your Trip Reservation,
                                    carefully review the reservation details of your chosen product or service for any
                                    such conditions. Iterwesttravels.com is not liable or responsible for any charges
                                    authorized or allegedly unauthorized by the Trip Provider. You cannot reclaim any
                                    amount for valid or authorized charges made by the Trip Provider (including for
                                    pre-paid rates, no-shows, and chargeable cancellations) to your credit card.

                                    In case of credit card fraud or unauthorized use by third parties, most banks and
                                    credit card companies cover all charges resulting from such fraud or misuse, which
                                    may be subject to a deductible depending on the bank or payment gateway provider's
                                    policies. To indemnify you, please report any fraud to your credit card provider
                                    according to its reporting rules and procedures and contact us immediately. Provide
                                    evidence of the charged deductible (e.g., credit card company policy). This

                                    By making a Trip Reservation with a Trip Provider, you acknowledge and consent to
                                    the applicable cancellation and no-show policy of that Trip Provider, as well as any
                                    additional terms and conditions (including fines) provided by the Trip Provider,
                                    which may apply to your Trip. This includes services rendered and/or products
                                    offered by the Trip Provider. Specific terms and conditions of a Trip Provider can
                                    be obtained directly from the Trip Provider. The general cancellation and no-show
                                    policy of each Trip Provider are accessible on our Platform, during the reservation
                                    process, and in the confirmation email or ticket, if applicable. Please note that
                                    certain rates, fees, or special offers may not be subject to cancellation, refund,
                                    or modification. In the event of a no-show or charged cancellation, the Trip
                                    Provider may still impose applicable city/tourist taxes. Prior to making your
                                    reservation, carefully review the details of your chosen product or service for any
                                    such conditions. A Trip Reservation requiring prepayment may be subject to
                                    cancellation if the remaining amount cannot be collected on the relevant due date
                                    according to the Trip Provider's payment policy.

                                    Cancellation and prepayment policies may vary depending on the segment, product, or
                                    service of each Trip. It is advisable to thoroughly read the Fine Print (located
                                    below the Trip types or at the bottom of each Trip Provider page on our Platform)
                                    and important information in your reservation confirmation for additional policies
                                    as applied by the Trip Provider (e.g., age requirements, security deposits,
                                    non-cancellation clauses, extra beds/no free breakfast, pets/cards accepted). Any
                                    issues resulting from late payment, incorrect bank details, invalid credit/debit
                                    cards, or insufficient funds are the responsibility of the user, and no refund will
                                    be provided unless permitted by the Trip Provider's payment and cancellation policy.

                                    If you wish to review, modify, or cancel your Trip Reservation, refer to the
                                    confirmation email and follow the provided instructions. Please note that
                                    cancellation charges may apply according to the Trip Provider's policy, and you may
                                    not be entitled to a refund of any prepaid amount. We advise reviewing the
                                    cancellation, prepayment, and no-show policy of the accommodation provider carefully
                                    before making your reservation and ensuring timely payments are made as required.

                                    In the event of a late or delayed arrival on the check-in date, or if you will
                                    arrive the next day, it is essential to inform the Trip Provider promptly to avoid
                                    cancellation of your Trip Reservation or incurring a no-show fee. Our customer
                                    service department can assist you in communicating with the Trip Provider if needed.

                                    Our goal is to present search results tailored to your preferences by offering a
                                    personalized default ranking of Trip Providers on our Platform. You have the
                                    flexibility to navigate through this default ranking, apply filters, and sort based
                                    on alternative criteria, granting you control over the display of search results. We
                                    utilize multiple algorithms to generate default ranking results, a process that
                                    continuously evolves.

                                    Iterwesttravels.com has identified key parameters closely associated with finding a
                                    suitable Trip Provider, prioritizing these parameters in our algorithms (main
                                    parameters). These include your personal search history, the rate of click-through
                                    from the search page to the hotel page, conversion rates (related to bookings versus
                                    visits), and the gross and net bookings of a Trip Provider. Conversion rates may be
                                    influenced by various factors, such as review scores, availability, pricing, and
                                    quality of content. Additionally, the commission percentage paid by the Trip
                                    Provider and participation in specific programs, like the Genius program and deals,
                                    can impact ranking. The Trip Provider's record of on-time payment also plays a role.
                                    Moreover, Trip Providers can enhance their ranking by participating in programs such
                                    as the Preferred Partner Program and the visibility booster, which involve paying a
                                    higher commission to us.

                                    Star ratings for accommodations on Iterwesttravels.com are determined either by the
                                    properties themselves or by independent third-party providers. Deals are displayed
                                    based on the star ratings assigned by providers to Iterwesttravels.com. Depending on
                                    local regulations, star classifications may be assigned by independent third parties
                                    or based on the accommodation provider's self-assessment. Iterwesttravels.com does
                                    not
                                    impose formal obligations on star ratings but aims to reflect how accommodations

                                    and services.

                                    properties. This rating is determined by considering over 400 features across five
                                    major categories: facilities, property configuration, photo quality, guest review
                                    scores, and historical booking data. Machine learning analysis based on these inputs
                                    results in a quality rating automatically calculated and awarded to each
                                    accommodation.
